The application doesn't use any third-party libraries, only UIKit and Foundation, so to run it, you need to open the .xcodeproj file and launch the app. To retrieve the list of books from OpenLibrary, you need to perform searches, whether it's a search by author or by title. However, I couldn't find a way to retrieve a simple list of books, such as by rating. Therefore, in this project, I chose the Harry Potter universe and fetched books based on their titles. The app makes API requests to OpenLibrary. One notable aspect of these requests is that it takes two queries to gather all the necessary information, and of course, the book cover image is fetched through a separate query. In the project, I've limited the number of books to 15, with plans to add search functionality and implement efficient book loading. At the moment, the app's appearance is as shown in the attached screenshots.
